							<strong>Reduce noise.</strong> It will need to take (more or less) precise measures by doing memory accesses, so try to reduce noise by exiting any unnecessary program that would use caches. Even scrolling in the console while it is running produces significant noise.</br>
							<strong>Check you use Firefox.</strong> I works best with Firefox, but it can also work with Google Chrome. Under no circumstances should you use Safari, it just won't work. No guarantees with other browsers (No tests).</br>
							<strong>Open the javascript console</strong> while you can, as soon as the script is launched, the page becomes unresponsive.</br>
							<strong>Hit the GO button.</strong> The script will start, it should terminate within a few minutes</br>
							<strong>Wait.</strong> Either the console prints "Done!" and the page displays some graphs below, or the console prints an error.</br>
							<strong>Save results.</strong> Try to save the last console messages and the graphs, if it succeeded. If it failed or you aborted, try to save the last console messages.</br>

							<strong>Wait.</strong> Either the console prints "Done!" and the page displays some graphs below, or the console prints an error, or the script is still running. A failed attempt might run unnecessarily long, feel free to abort after a reasonable time if you need to.</br>
							<strong>Save results.</strong> Try to save the last console messages and the graphs, if it succeeded. If it failed or you aborted, try to save the last console messages and a message saying "summary of eviction sets found:", to see what went wrong and what it was doing.</br>
